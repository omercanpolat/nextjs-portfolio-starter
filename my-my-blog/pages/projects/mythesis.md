This thesis analyzes the factors that are associated with separation behavior among United States Air Force pilots. 
Additionally, the effect of commissioning source on separation was analyzed. Logistic regression models were estimated for U.S. Air Force pilots commissioned between 1994 and 2006. Data records utilized in this thesis were obtained from Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). Demographics and professional/educational factors were included in the models to analyze their effects on the separation decision. By identifying the determinants of separation, the thesis attempts to suggest ways in which decision makers might reduce losses among Air Force pilots.This thesis analyzes the factors that are associated with separation behavior among United States Air Force pilots.
